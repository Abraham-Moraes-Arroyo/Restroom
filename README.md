# Restroom
Here is a web page that can help new and returning students on where to find a restroom when they need to take care of their needs. I did this because I saw that UIC did not have an app or a web page that would help fix this issue. As a result I have decided to come up with a solution that would benefit everyone who goes to UIC. I have left QR codes in campus, with approval, and there was activity on the site. 

I posted the link to web page on reddit and it generated over 6k visits, by the first week. It seems that the site generates a lot of activity during the start of a semmester, but then it looses acitivy towards the end. I think the reason behind this is because the students and staff have already located their way to their classes, lunch rooms, and bathrooms. 

 I own this project I made it from the ground up utilizing: Bootstrap, Google API, and GitHub Pages. Please don't make copies of my work. I don't grant anyone permission to copy or use my code without permission.
